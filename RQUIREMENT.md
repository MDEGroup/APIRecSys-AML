We developed and tested the tools involved in the experiments on
different Linux systems, although it should work without any issue on
any operating system. In the instructions, we assume a Linux system and
basic command line skills.

In our case, the testing platform is a PC with Linux 4.20.3, Intel
Core i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz and 16GB of RAMWe developed and tested the tools involved in the experiments on different Linux systems, although it should work without any issue on any operating system. In the instructions, we assume a Linux system and basic command line skills.
